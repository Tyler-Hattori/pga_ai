# Applying an Encoder Model to Predict PGA Tourament Standings

I joined a PGA fantasy league and I wanted to be able to identify undervalued players... didn't work! There were simply too many variables I was tuning and not enough data. I'm sure there is a way to make this applicable in some sense, but I was doing this for fun and was living out of my car at the time. For the most part, it was nice to brush up on the Transformer Encoder and learn how to glean data from html code!
